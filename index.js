// Add your code here
/*
write a method, submitData, that takes two strings arguments,
one representing a user's name and the other representing a user's email.

The first two tests mirror the behavior of the JSON server.
As you write your solution, keep the server running to test your code.
Open index.html in a browser to gain access to your submitData function in console.

Note: The tests in this lab need access to the fetch() request inside submitData.
In order to give them access, write you solution so that submitData returns the fetch().
This will not change the behavior of your fetch().

    3. a) A body with the name and email passed in as arguments to submitData.
